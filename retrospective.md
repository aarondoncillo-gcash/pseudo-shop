# Final Project Retrospective

## Team Members
- Student 1: Ralph Daniel Batitay Honra
- Student 2: Ronan Aaron Doncillo

## 1. How did you divide the work between you and your partner?
_(Who worked on which features? How was the work assigned or negotiated?)_
Both me (student 1) and my partner (student 2) have different focus on the project, student 1 worked on User registration/login and product filtering via product attributes. We encounter difficulties on each of our assigned feature but solved them eventually by helping each other out.

## 2. What Git strategies or commands helped you most during the project?
_(E.g., branching, rebasing, frequent commits, etc.)_
Git strategies that we applied are the continuous usage of git log and descriptive commit meassage, using both of these, navigating code changes or modifications can be easily tracked by using this git strategies.

## 3. Describe a merge conflict you encountered. What caused it and how did you resolve it?
_(Include any lessons learned or techniques used to resolve the issue.)_
We encountered merge conflict on the first feature, about the filter products by attributes, the cause of the merge conflict is the placement of the code, even though I worked on the filtering of the products, my partner worked on the adding of products, since we are both creating it on a new file, it cause a merge conflict on some of the code placement in the file. But overall we fixed it by communicating with each other on what to delete and retain.

## 4. What were the biggest challenges you faced as a team?
_(This can include communication, Git usage, or coordination.)_

## 5. What did you learn about using Git in a collaborative setting?
_(Any insights or habits youâ€™d apply in future projects?)_

## 6. How would you improve your workflow next time?
_(Think about technical habits and teamwork practices.)_

## 7. Optional: Any feedback on the activity?
_(What worked well? What was confusing or could be improved?)_
