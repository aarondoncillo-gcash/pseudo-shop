# Final Project Retrospective

## Team Members
- Student 1:
- Student 2:

## 1. How did you divide the work between you and your partner?
_(Who worked on which features? How was the work assigned or negotiated?)_

## 2. What Git strategies or commands helped you most during the project?
_(E.g., branching, rebasing, frequent commits, etc.)_

## 3. Describe a merge conflict you encountered. What caused it and how did you resolve it?
_(Include any lessons learned or techniques used to resolve the issue.)_

## 4. What were the biggest challenges you faced as a team?
_(This can include communication, Git usage, or coordination.)_
One of the challenges we faced was coordination in handling our assigned feature tickets. We overlooked some interdependencies during planning, which led to blockers during development. When development started, one team member had to wait for another ticket to be completed and merged to main before they could finish theirs. Another challenge is unfamiliarity with the Git or Github workflow, especially when it came to creating pull request. Another challenge was time constraints due to one of the member's limited availability, which affected out progress and development

## 5. What did you learn about using Git in a collaborative setting?
_(Any insights or habits you’d apply in future projects?)_
It improves productivity, collaboration, and independence in a team. It allows us to work on our tasks at our own pace and setting. We can simultaneously work on our assigned feature tickets independently and easily switch between branches when we need to make quick changes to other tasks. Git also enhances collaboration by making it easy to track the progress of feature branches, see who writes specific lines of code, and safely experiment on separate branches without affecting  the main branch. One important habit we would apply in future is properly managing branches and resolving merge conflicts.

## 6. How would you improve your workflow next time?
_(Think about technical habits and teamwork practices.)_
Better planning of featured tickets to identify ticket dependencies early. Proper naming of branches and giving descriptive commit messages. Avoid committing too frequently for every small changes. Commits should be made based on milestones/stages of a feature. Lastly, maintaining constant communication and updates between team members  to avoid duplicated work, risks, and blockers.

## 7. Optional: Any feedback on the activity?
_(What worked well? What was confusing or could be improved?)_
Activity was great as it gave us similar hands-on experience working in a real development setup
